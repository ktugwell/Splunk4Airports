## Airports Common Information Model (CIM)

The Airport CIM was created to help unify the experience Airports users have when using Splunk. It features a vast list of the most common used fields within an airport, and what you should call them.

This CIM has been created based on the IATA AIDX Schema. [https://www.iata.org/en/publications/info-data-exchange/]
